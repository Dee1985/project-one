Brew Cruze
Live site:
 
Description
This repository is for creating an application to locate breweries while traveling. This is our first group project for our web development program. The Brew Cruz application will locate breweries in between a starting location and ending location, with waypoints as an options. The user has the ability to input their current location, final destination and search results will produce a list of breweries (URL included when applicable) that are within those parameters. Additional functionality includes a map identifying the brewery results, turn by turn navigation with zoom capabilities and a responsive interface.
 
Usage:
The usage of this application is for the general public to easily locate breweries on their travel route.

Contributing
For our first group project, we had a team of five members: Jesse Edwards - Project Manager, AyDy Burling - Designer, Samantha Sengsouvanh - Designer, Austin Schlander - Web Developer, Ryan Ellingson - Web Developer.
 
Challenges:
The initial germination of the project proved to be the most difficult. Due to situational constraints (i.e point in curriculum, funding and other lack of resources), we as a group, were limited to select APIs. Consequently, some additional user functionality (referenced further in "roadmap" section) are currently attainable, thus limiting the scope of the user experience.
 
Utilizing a new CSS framework took some adjustment, concepts such as row and column manipulation as well as getting familiar with the various components. Since Bootstrap 4.4 was our starting reference point, Bulma did not prove to be much different but, as expected, there were some cosmetic differences.
 
Another hurdle that is ongoing was the manipulation of the API response. This is in respect to combining two data APIs and being able to draw the appropriate functionality from them. An example of this would be generating the list of breweries. Our team of developers had to figure out how to convert the Mapquest location data response (city,state) into a format that the brewery API could recognize.
 
The open source brewery API that we utilized does acknowledge that more data is needed to have a more comprehensive list of breweries in the US and internationally. This, in turn, limits the database available for users. 
 
Mapquest did offer turn by turn navigation, but not real time navigation, something that we as a society have become accustomed to. 
 
 
Successes:
Our team was able to effectively work in a cohesive and diplomatic manner. With the utilization of Slack as a communication platform, we were able to discuss strengths and weakness of each member and then formally assign tasks via Github During class hours, we had mini caucus moments to discuss where we were at in our project, any individual setbacks/delays and also ideas about what we wanted to still incorporate. Although the personalities in our group were quite eclectic; the open and accepting environment was pretty much inherent in nature, and this led to the honest discussion of skills and vulnerabilities. It has been a pleasure to see our ideas come to fruition.
